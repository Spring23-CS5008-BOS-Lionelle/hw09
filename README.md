## Questions

1. Add a markdown table demonstrating the in practice time for Hashmaps. 
2. What is the worst case time for a hashmap, even if rare, can you come up with a condition that always generates worst case?
3. Looking back at the Lab09, how often did you see collisions from the various data sizes? (go ahead and copy/paste the output from the lab)
4. To make this hashmap fully usable - what are some functions missing that should be implemented? (props if you implement them!)
   * if you are stuck, think about how would someone get all the names of the food items, if they are doing inventory?
5. How can hashmaps help you with dynamic programming? Are they effective mechanisms for caches? 



## Important notes

* You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**
